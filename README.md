### History and Stories of Bicycle Racing 1975 to now (2016)

Hello all,

My name is Vincent Davis, and I, and all of you, are going to help Steve write this book. How are we going to help? Here's the plan.

As the book is written, there will be two parts: 1) public content, which is what we need your help with, and 2) release day content. The release day content will be made up of interviews with historical and current people within the bicycle industry,in addition to video, photos and other content. The public content will be stories, history, how cycling has changed and evolved, the people that have been important to the history of cycling within the US.
